FOREWORD.

This Romanized Edition of the Holy Scriptures in the Hinghwa Dialect is not an independent transla-tion. Such a task would be as unnecessary as it is impossible. With the comparatively small number of missionaries working in the confines of this dialect, it was impracticable to have a Committee to do this work. We have utilized the best and most modern translations of the Bible in Classical Chinese. In this Revision, the great work of Bishop Schereschewsky has been con-stantly employed. However, the translation work has been done entirely by my Chinese colabourers. After they had done their best, I have endeavored to correct the translation, comparing with the American Revision. Unless there appeared to be an imperative reason for modification, the Standard Chinese translations were followed as to meaning.
The thanks of the whole Christain Community in Hinghwa, as well as my own, are due to my efficient and laborious fellow workers, Rev. Lin Hung-wan, Mr. Chen Ching-hsen, Mr. Yang Shao-hsun and Mr. Chen Chu-ying. They have spared no pains to make the work what it is. No one can be as keenly conscious of its defects as I. It is an improvement, I believe, over the first edition, in translation, and especially in typography.
The American Bible Society has made possible the publication, and sale at about one fifth of the cost. We cannot be too grateful for this help.
If the Christian Chinese who speak the Hinghwa Dialect will be stimulated thereby to read, love, and obey the Word of God, and to teach others so to do, all who have had any share in the production of this volume will feel that they have received ample reward.
